//Counting Array Elements:
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5569b10074fe4a6715000054


//Problem
Write a function that takes an array and counts the number of each unique element present.

count(['james', 'james', 'john']) 
#=> { 'james' => 2, 'john' => 1}


//My Solution
def count(array)
  count = Hash.new(0)
  array.each { |name| count[name] += 1 }
  return count
end


//Working
I started by creating a hash called count.
I then iterated through the array, adding 1 to the hash for each element of the name that exists in the original array.
